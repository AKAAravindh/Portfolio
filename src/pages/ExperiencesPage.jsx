I built responsive and visually appealing interfaces using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. On the backend, I implemented Node.js and Express.js to handle server logic, integrated MongoDB for database management, and worked with JWT authentication, session- and cookie-based authorization, and CRUD operations. I also connected front-end interfaces to RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless functionality. These projects helped me translate ideas into functional web solutions, strengthen my problem-solving abilities, and gain practical experience building secure, user-friendly, and real-world applications.",
